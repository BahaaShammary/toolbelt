# Use Cases

## As a Technology Layperson:
- I want to know that the goods and software I use are safe and secure and I am not open to scary exploits.
- I am more concerned about my data than I am about the technicalities of the exploits/vulnerabilities.
- I want my software “to just work” and how it is assembled/secured should be invisible to me.  I need to know my information is protected.
  
## As an Open Source Consumer 
- I need to understand the security posture of the software I am ingesting and I need a trusted source for this security information.
- I need to understand the supported lifecycle of the software I am ingesting and using within my Enterprise to make risk-based decisions.  
- I expect the software provider to follow secure & privacy by design practices.
- I need to integrate upstream sources with other tools within my organization, and develop/support the automation and integration of my own software tooling/platform.
- I am concerned about the completeness of the data I am receiving about my upstream sources and that they are following current regulatory/compliance requirements.
- I do not have the capabilities to do upstream security work myself (whether technical ability, tooling, or legal/business reasons).
- I want to use good quality open source software to build secure products so I can accelerate my development and release cycles.  This includes both software that I integrate into my products as well as the components I use to build them.
  
## As an Open Source Maintainer
- I want to make high-quality software that is well-regarded, solves real-world problems. I want to showcase the security qualities and practices of my project.
- I want my software to be resistant to security threats, and address known/emerging vulnerabilities, but I have limited time and resources and need automated help to achieve this
- As a consumer of open source software, I want to understand the security qualities of the components in my supply chain
- I need to be able to choose what I reveal about my information assets (e.g. software, my supply chain, my project roadmap, open defects, or about myself, my maintainers, and my project community). I care about how my project is reflected in external metrics that accurately represent the security of my work..
- I want the tooling in my secure supply chain to be fully automated and well integrated so that my security work can be quick and efficient.
- I need to understand the requirements and downstream consumer demands of my software
- I need my tooling to express the security posture of my activities and provide trusted data around the security of my project.
- I need my tooling to provide data to enable trust in the artifacts I provide to my community that allows my consumers to verify the integrity and authenticity of the output.  
- I need to inform my downstream consumers about the data they care about in an automated fashion.  I need tooling and automation to support this.
- I need to deliver artifacts in a secure fashion.  I need tooling and automation to support this.
