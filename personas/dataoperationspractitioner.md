## Name: Susan the Data Engineer

### Role:
- Senior Data Platform Engineer at a financial institution

### Background:
- Susan manages large-scale data pipelines using Spark, Airflow, and custom ingestion services. She works closely with data scientists and analysts to ensure reliable delivery of datasets for ML and BI. Recently, she began contributing to an OpenSSF working group focused on securing data pipelines. Juggling this with internal compliance obligations and technical debt has been challenging, but she’s driven by the desire to help modernize how data infrastructure supports secure ML.

### Goals:
- Improve pipeline observability and introduce security checks at ingestion points
- Enable her organization to adopt secure data provenance and validation practices
- Contribute to and benefit from open-source solutions for ML data security

#### Personal
- Develop leadership in secure data engineering practices
- Balance community contributions with high-pressure enterprise responsibilities

#### Project
- Embed security scanning into existing ETL workflows without major refactors
- Use lessons from OpenSSF to develop reusable internal patterns for data integrity

#### Organization
- Demonstrate compliance through end-to-end data traceability
- Support ML teams with trustworthy, auditable datasets

### Challenges:
- Hard to justify time spent on upstream contributions in a fast-paced compliance-driven org
- Many OSS data pipeline tools lack security or signing support by default
- No standardized way to prove pipeline-level integrity or control input quality
- Security controls often live outside data pipelines and are hard to align with platform architecture

### How the OpenSSF can help:
- Publish hardened examples of secure ML data pipelines with reproducible, signed inputs
- Develop integrations with pipeline orchestrators like Airflow and dbt for metadata and signature enforcement
- Make the Scorecard and SLSA framework applicable to data pipelines and ingestion systems
- Provide contributor templates, Slack access, and async-friendly contribution guides to lower the barrier for part-time contributors

#### If contributing to OpenSSF project
- Susan benefits from collaboration with peers facing similar issues across industries
- Access to code examples, contributor templates, and async support for patching pipeline tools

#### If using OpenSSF tools in enterprise
- Tools for signing and verifying datasets used in retraining loops
- Reference architectures and policies for aligning ML data pipelines with secure software supply chain practices

## Name: Noura the Data Governance Analyst

### Role:
- Data Privacy and Compliance Lead in a government agency

### Background:
- Noura ensures that data used in analytics and ML respects privacy regulations and internal policies. She’s responsible for approvals, classification, and tracking lineage. Her technical knowledge is moderate, but her role is critical in assessing risk and enabling compliance.

### Goals:
- Prevent use of unapproved or sensitive data in ML systems
- Maintain traceability of data usage and transformations
- Support safe data sharing across teams and partners

#### Personal
- Reduce manual review cycles through clear controls and metadata
- Empower teams to follow data policies without creating bottlenecks

#### Project
- Flag and audit sensitive data use across ML systems
- Ensure ML outputs do not leak private or restricted information

#### Organization
- Meet privacy regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA
- Build public trust through responsible data stewardship

### Challenges:
- Difficult to enforce policies when ML pipelines are opaque
- No visibility into how data flows through models once deployed
- Limited tooling for assessing third-party ML component risk
- Compliance processes are reactive and documentation-heavy

### How the OpenSSF can help:
- Provide schemas and tooling for data classification and policy tagging in ML workflows
- Promote integrations between metadata tracking and ML toolchains
- Offer standards for auditability and explainability in AI governance
- Create pathways for compliance automation using policy-as-code templates

## Name: Daniel the Data Scientist

### Role:
- Applied ML Researcher in a healthcare startup

### Background:
- Daniel develops machine learning models using clinical data. She frequently experiments with new datasets, pretrained models, and open-source ML libraries. While experienced in model evaluation and performance metrics, she is less familiar with security threats in ML workflows and often unaware of potential risks in data or pretrained components.

### Goals:
- Deliver accurate and explainable ML models
- Maintain compliance with health data privacy regulations
- Reproduce experiments for audit and debugging

#### Personal
- Become a leader in applying ML to health outcomes
- Ensure her work aligns with responsible and ethical AI practices

#### Project
- Produce high-performing models without introducing bias or security risks
- Ensure models can be maintained and evaluated over time

#### Organization
- Align with security, regulatory, and reproducibility standards
- Avoid data leakage and model misuse

### Challenges:
- Lacks tooling to detect poisoned or anomalous training data
- Security validation steps are not integrated into notebooks or pipelines
- Difficult to track lineage and integrity of datasets and models
- No standard process for documenting model security posture

### How the OpenSSF can help:
- Create developer-friendly tools to flag insecure datasets and dependencies within ML environments
- Offer templates and standards for model cards with reproducibility and security metadata
- Promote open-source privacy-preserving defaults and example pipelines for common ML tasks
- Advocate for adversarial robustness and input validation best practices in ML tooling
