<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* LF Member Summit threat model discussion:
    * Would it be best to have a single entity in OpenSSF align on threat models first
    * ML: Agrees.  Lots of threats in both areas.  Maybe categorize things instead of unique things with very similar results.
    * RW: Agrees.  We should all be using the same amount of threats.
    * CRob: “Compromised Developer” instead of developer bribed and developer threatened
    * Agreement.  ML: given that shouldn’t we focus on build instead of developer?
        * What actor attacks the source repo?
        * CRob had hoped Developer universe might be a bit smaller.
        * ML: Maybe focus on threats to repositories and infrastructure.
* All agree upon a pattern on how we want to document our threats.  CRob will focus on developers for next week.  Today we will focus on SCM.
    * ML: Isn’t this really just actor pushes malicious or vulnerable code to repo or deletes code
    * JB: How can we do try to accommodate for these various profiles?
    * CRob: Propose instead of listing off many ways something can be broken, a single categorical statement.  Likes “Actor pushes malicious or vulnerable code to repo or deletes code” instead of 7 other variations that may not have significant differences
    * Added category for direct manipulation of SCM contents
    * Actor implements poor repo permissions
    * Reduce the flavors of threats unless there are true reasons to expand
    * No other suggests to the new 3 category approach
* CI/CD
    * Is there value in focusing on CI and CD separately?  Build doesn’t equal to CI but much of the same
    * Changing section to ‘Build/CI’ and dropping CD
    * 3 different categories suggested by ML
    * Focus on “actor” and not motivation
    * Build environment pushes/pulls vulnerable or malicious code
        * Either someone pushes malicious code into the build.
        * Malicious code generally comes from an approved place so separating that out from malicious dependencies
    * Third, actor turns off security checks in pipeline
    * JB: Good to make this more focused instead of trying to come up with an exhaustive list
    * CRob: How do we add CD back in?
        * ML: Lets focus on the producer side of things and not consumer side of things right now
        * CRob: Maybe SLSA friends can help elaborate
    * CRob: Welcome everyone to think about assumptions
* Publication/Distribution
    * ML Should be pretty easy.  Categories created (actor pushes malicious… and Unauthorized actor pulls…)
* Break here for today

    * CRob is walking the group through the example structure of a threat analysis
    * A structured template (which is also aligned with the analysis of the end user WG) helps to align different initiatives and also to dedup threat analyses done across different groups
    * The group discussed how this effort relates to the threat modeling done in the end users WG
    * [Toolbelt Threat Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e8F580P1oB-WVdwkO9AzM9NFRBUiz5KWF1lEqxGG0Io/edit#gid=0) correlating all threat analysis efforts across the OpenSSF
* The group started working on the threats related to consumers in the threats document next
    * We will use the following pattern: _symptom/deficiency/issue  + action by something/one + effect_

* Calendar may have an issue. Some folks were on a different zoom meeting. Those who went through LF got on, those who selected the link from the calendar went to a different meeting. 

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* **On personas**, 
    * CRob indicated that we still have a few personas we have not addressed, but the document is close to being done.
    * Sarah indicated that reading the doc required some scrolling and asked for some links. CRob indicated that he did not have time to make those enhancements and would ask David Wheeler for help on that. CRob will get it published ASAP.
* **On End User Working group**,
    *  CRob pointed out what the EUWG is and who is involved in the working group. He explained that the End Users have been working on a Threat Model document. [BLOG](https://openssf.org/blog/2023/09/27/threat-modeling-the-supply-chain-for-software-consumers/) CRob indicated that there were other groups working on Threat Models and there may be some interest in consolidating the models.
    *  Sarah Evans indicated she had not enough time to review the End User’s threat model and wanted a chance before we discussed.
    *  Michael L. indicated he did like the End User’s model. Jonathan Meadows indicated that he appreciated the work the End Users have done. He also explained that the FinOs group has also been working on threat models. He also indicated that working with NIST on threat models may be useful. He mentioned understanding the linkage between the threat models and having a way to discuss threats, mitigation and control and not re-invent ‘stuff.’ CRob indicated that we need someone to create a table that can consolidate all of the higher-level threats so we can see where there might be duplication, etc.
    * CRob discussed ways we may be able to reach out to other groups to help consolidate the threat model data. Some discussion around the Mitre Threat models with a concern that Mitre’s model does not focus on supply chain, yet that could change. Jonathan indicated that FinOS had reached out to Mitre on the supply chain topic.
    *  CRob posted a link to Henkrik Plake’s model. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04008](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04008). Sarah indicated that she has some interest in working with Mitre on the supply chain threat model. 
    * Matthew Coles indicated he has been working with Mitre on attack scenarios and could help with that discussion. CRob asked Matthew to log his thoughts around attack frameworks for future discussion.  
    * CRob indicated he would work on getting a coordinated call with Henrick and other groups on threat modeling and attack frameworks. 
* **On Threats,**
    * Michael Lieberman indicated that CI/CD was important and having a way to see unauthrorized actors having access to the build and tamper with the orchestration should be considered. 
    * Tracy Ragan reminded the group that the CDF had been working on these issues. Jenkins has an audit project. Teckton has audits. Pyrsia is a build consensus network that hardens the build and meets SLSA standards.
    * CRob suggested that we need a trust boundary analysis with some scratch diagrams. Matthew Cole volunteered to give it a shot. 
    * Tracy Ragan indicated that deployments should be included in the disucssion. Steve Taylor reminded us that there are different types of deployments. 
    * Tracy Ragan indicated that any script driven proces has vulnerabilities which includes builds, deployments and CI. 
    * Matthew indicated that scripts were better than manual activity. He questioned the types of deployments that should be included, test, production, git releases. 
    * Steve Taylor indicated from a solutions point of view the chain of events in the deployment process should be audited. 
    * Sarah Evans asked about the signing of code being compromised. If the Certificate Authority is compromised it could be an achilles heel to the process. 
    * Marcela Melara asked about how we draw the line between infrastructure and human misuse of infrastructure. She agreed with Sarah in the CA being compromised. She stated that the type of CI/CD model - hosted, local, etc should be considered in the CI/CD section. 
    * Victor Lu indicated that the discovery of CI/CD tool should be automated. He indicated that the CI/CD good be bootstrapped.
    * Daniel Applequist reminded us that the package being pushed through the pipeline should be considered.

<h3>Agenda</h3>




* Anyone willing to assist in scribing?
* Welcome new friends
* Collect Opens
* David: I suspect many of us have been overwhelmed from the US government meeting + OSS EU 2023/OpenSSF Day.
* What about threat modeling?
    * David A. Wheeler: I had tried to consolidate personas, use cases, threats, & controls. I created a skeleton with a few examples to see what that would end up like here, let me know if that’d help: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iAB2ljfIRUTWjL3bONej3vMjsUXuUj44oV5eLVpifbs/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iAB2ljfIRUTWjL3bONej3vMjsUXuUj44oV5eLVpifbs/edit)
    * It’d be good to have a common view the personas fit in to
    * E.g., here’s the diagram from the diagrammers’ society:

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* On personas - adding OpenSSF personas to ours?
    * Georg: Shouldn’t we consolidate personas?
    * CRob - the mvsr is foundation-wide - governing board and TAC are working on it. There are other groups doing personas in the foundation. We could absorb all personas … we cound federate … we could find someoneone else…
    * Sarah: I have been the editor fo the openssf MVSR - key objective to facilitate collaboration. We wanted our roadmap to identify personas with whom we’d collaborate. Would love to have a list of groups that have personas - let’s not hold the MVSR hostage.
    * John: the GB - encourage this group - the government side - the MVSR captures policy… some of these things we’re working on could become government standards - so we should have a persona for the government.
    * David: I have done some merging… e.g. personas … with the goal of producing a canonical list… then have an inventory of use cases / threat models [built on top]. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iAB2ljfIRUTWjL3bONej3vMjsUXuUj44oV5eLVpifbs/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iAB2ljfIRUTWjL3bONej3vMjsUXuUj44oV5eLVpifbs/edit) The idea would be : identify the personas, what they do… then a big table comes out of that. 
    * Dan: do we have to consolidate?  Some of the personas are about what the OpenSSF does rather than what actors in the supply chain do.
    * Michael: I feel like someone should own the general personas - having one group own it - we can move in that direction over time.
    * Crob: agree. There will be a OpenSSF chief architect joining in October - this could be that person.
    * Tracy: this is not easy - creating personas .. is hard. We don’t have a brilliant persona doc right now. OpenSSF does have a new community director - this should be in her wheelhouse. High level persona doc that we can add to or make our own. Maybe we need to turn this over to someone more professional. Let’s pass it over to be consolidated.
    * Crob: that’s wise advice. I would suggest adding a few of these into our persona doc - governments, academics.. And then hand over.
    * Arnaud: totally fine with that - but do we have someone who knows that’s her job?
    * Crob: to talk to [community manager] and [architect].
    * Tracy: she is working on personas for dev rel and marketing…
* Use case Doc: [OpenSSF Security toolbelt Use Cases - DRAFT - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10oFJrMcIkKb0X7Bw1EwrN1w_wbyVUj0EAUswXMp73lQ/edit?pli=1#heading=h.pmnr72fd8v8b)
    * CRob: can manage these through github: [toolbelt/use_cases at main · ossf/toolbelt (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/tree/main/use_cases) 
    * CRob: “As an open source supplier I need to be able to assess quality open source software to integrate into my products and services.”
    * Dan: “As an open source supplier I want to be able to configure my public repository in a secure way.”
    * Michael: we should ask people….
    * Dan: “... I want to be able to [something something SBOMs]”
    * John: should be “software supplier” rather than “open source supplier”
    * “I need to close the gap between my organizational policies and …”
    * [working in the Use Case document…]
    * “I need to provide my downstream consumers with attestations…”
    * [working in use case doc now]
    * Some discussion on what is proprietary vs. what is required for transparency… 
* Threat models…: [OpenSSF Security Toolbelt Threats - DRAFT - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RG4_JeUWlx1AMHh6XAhEuVhyoaYqfiBSr789HTnSVEM/edit?pli=1#heading=h.p2mmdnf7yli9)
    * Crob: we start with light threat modeling and get into more rigorous… 
    * MIchael: “we’re threat modeling the software delivery lifecycle for open source” - and then saying “here are the things to secure that end-to-end”
    * Brandon: we should then circle-back and revisit this threat model work.
    * David: +1
    * Crob: end user working group has a threat model that focuses on consumption… [OpenSSF Threat Models - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLCsT0a5vp6FcvquWPzx8AzhFMORyw-4rd9WSyUO9zI/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)
    * David: I merged in SLSA & SC2CF… SC2CF - the examples are very good. End goal should be a table of threats, examples, controls & countermeasures..
    * Jay: on both sides - with SC2CF in threats section - this is continuously evolving - we should work with SC2CF to ensure both sets of threats are made better.
    * Crob: propose that next time we dive into threat model piece… starting off with the developer and moving our way through the process… think about what our intended users are, what the use is, and “what could go wrong.” ← **HOMEWORK** 📚

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>

    * Michael is suggesting more sub-use-cases regarding the layperson 

        covering data security.

    * A layperson does not care about the technical details and inter-workings involved in secure software development. Software should just work.
    * We have deferred fleshing out the "layperson" persona for the time being. Since a layperson has no understanding of secure software and does not care, we should focus on the other personas for now.
* Use cases of Open Source Consumer
    * We are discussing the use case that a consumer may expect that the developers of open source software to follow secure by design best practices.
    * This may be a challenging expectation for single maintainer projects
* Use cases of Open Source Maintainers
    * Agreeing that a maintainer is also a consumer who cares about his/her supply chain
    * Strengthening the requirement for simple and easy to use tooling

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* Changing our name to **Assembly**?
    * Some discussion…
* Use case document - Crob presents the newly defined personas in the use case doc… 
    * Will enter these personas into a library of personas that everyone would use - e.g. vuln disclosure, …
    * Will take these as a way to look back at our use cases…
    * There are also “marketing” personas - but these are related to how the OpenSSF works with the community.
    * Some discussion on the “Finder” persona - generally good feedback.
    * Discussion on use cases:
    * Next step : threat modeling
    * Crob to get this into github (not CVS)
* Threat modeling - some work has been going on in the End User working group
    *

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* New Friends
    * John Kjell from Testifysec
* This effort should live in a working group. Maybe [ the BEST group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/207).
    * What that means, someone from this meeting needs to go to the working group meeting and report on what’s going on.
    * Should it be the security tooling group?
        * in 3 years they’ve managed one tool, they’ve been focused on SBOMs.
        * Tooling working group seems like it might be going away (at the very least they need a new lead)? SBOM work sent to SBOM everywhere.
            * WG would need a new lead
    * Could also consider the Supply Chain Integrity working group
        * Problem: they have a lot of high visibility projects and we might not get very much support since they’ll be busy with those other high vis projects
    * If we go to BEST we can keep going without organizational changes.
        * Would help us keep moving with less paperwork.
        * Can always rehome later if needed.
    * The blending of things we’re trying to focus on here seems like a good fit for BEST.
    * There is some urgency to finding a solution.
        * “Strongly urged by staff to find a home”
    * Business decision -> BEST (vs technical decision which might send us somewhere else)
    * Our position in the org chart shouldn’t affect our ability to interact with other entities.
    * Why is this so urgent?
        * Staff is trying to make the foundation more consistent, align docs and reporting, better harmony, etc…
        * Unclear why our group is being dismissed the way it is.
        * Note that this effort isn’t being discouraged or deprioritized.  Purely a bureaucratic move.
        * BEST does have 3 software tooling projects under it, so it’s not a completely strange fit.
    * CRob can only support if we go to BEST, otherwise we’ll need to find someone else to represent.
    * Can vote on the GitHub issue [by commenting](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/207)?
        * Only people listed in project collaborators will have their vote counted.
    * Strong support for just making a decision quickly.
    * Any objections to lazy concensus with a lazy hand vote?
        * None
    * 7 in favor of BEST
    * No other votes.
    * **_Decision: will move to the BEST working group._**
    * CRob to handle the paperwork.
* [Use Cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10oFJrMcIkKb0X7Bw1EwrN1w_wbyVUj0EAUswXMp73lQ/edit#heading=h.pmnr72fd8v8b)
    * [Siddharth the Supplier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10oFJrMcIkKb0X7Bw1EwrN1w_wbyVUj0EAUswXMp73lQ/edit#heading=h.dnshax2ei8em)
        * Re challenges
            * Need to add when the upstream has no plans/bandwidth/ability to make fixes in <timeframe>
                * e.g. pyxml broke and the maintainers weren’t able to fix ‘fast enough’, what are the downstream user’s options in these cases?
        * Compliance
            * On the commercial side folks seem to go for the minimal set of properties to expose.
            * How should we document that?  Do we need to ‘support’ it?
                * CRob: we don’t need to support everything listed here, but still helpful to document.
            * Good to include it (minimize data to expose) as a goal , but we can decide if we want to support it later.
            * Goal: often when they say “hey I’m looking to comply with the law” they mean “the minimum I have to do to comply and not one bit more”
            * If we provide anything else it’s outside the scope of what the law requires.
            * Might not send an SBOM upfront, but wait until you’re asked.
        * Added some _sub_ personas
            * Startup - fast, nimble
            * Legacy - slow, deliberate
                * “We’re all building the legacy software of tomorrow”
                * “Legacy is a synonym for working”
                * This is the reality for many cases.  Should not denigrate.
            * Probably important to keep in mind because how these sub-personas respond to problems will be very different.
    * [Ursula the Upstream Maintainer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10oFJrMcIkKb0X7Bw1EwrN1w_wbyVUj0EAUswXMp73lQ/edit#heading=h.1fqkhtpjhhg9)
        * How interested would Ursula be to leverage a SLSA compliance GItHub action (or similar).  E.g. what level of effort is too much?
            * Folks probably OK with a GHA, “I just have to add this thing, fine”
            * Challenge, only has so much time in her day.  Doesn’t want to expose people to security problems, but doesn’t have a ton of capacity.
            * Looking for input on what would actually help (there are lots of options), and would certainly approve PRs to make adoption easy.
        * Provide an easy onramp to the org that has resources to reduce the burden of maintenance
            * E.g. <thing> became super popular and needs additional support that Ursula can’t provide herself.  How can she easily get the help the project needs?
        * Constraints
            * Total time
            * Big blocks of time are hard to come by
            * Things that can be done in 15 min blocks much easier than 4 hour blocks.
            * PRs with obvious benefit are great.
                * This is probably what we’re looking for.
                * Better would be having to do nothing, but that might not be attainable.
            * We might be thinking of this as an end-to-end problem, but it’s important to be able to break that down into small chunks that are easily consumable.
        * Is there an opportunity to move Ursula from reactive to something more proactive
            * E.g. understand the demands that are coming her way and make decisions ahead of time.
            * Yes there’s definitely opportunity for this.
            * Focus on how we can help people get there.
        * What would the story for _Ursula’s _user look like?
            * Can they easily create an issue for Ursula to address?
            * Lower the communication barrier between Ursula and her users.
            * Some of this does go with the downstream consumer personas (elsewhere in doc)
    * [Mary’s persona](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10oFJrMcIkKb0X7Bw1EwrN1w_wbyVUj0EAUswXMp73lQ/edit#heading=h.4n3tbxycnyuy) has been restructured to bullets away from paragraphs.
        * Please review and if it looks good we can delete the paragraphs.
    * Seems like we’re close to completion with use cases. Ready to move to threat modeling next week?
        * No objections.
        * Templates for threat modeling in the doc. PTAL
        * Patterns are also available in the doc.
    * Do we need to circle back to the use cases now that the personas have been resolved?
        * We started on personas because we had trouble with use cases.
        * Yes, we should.  We’ll do this. (next week?)

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* Find a proper home for this activity
    * Foundation staff is requesting to find a proper home in a WG
    * The BEST WG has been proposed
    * A discussion is happening here: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/207](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/207) 
    * Another proposals are the Supply Chain Integrity WG or Security Tooling WG
    * CRob and Jay proposed an activity some time ago which would develop overarching concepts (e.g., taxonomies, personas, etc.) which would be a fitting home as well. However, spinning this up would require extra effort.
* Use Cases
    * Mary the (corporate) Maintainer
        * The group likes the content. Potentially switching to a bulleted list (e.g., for the goals) could make the content more consumable
        * Micheal proposes a second maintainer persona: while Mary is doing open source development as part of her work, there are also maintainers who work on code only in their free time. The group agrees that this persona is very relevant, too.
    * Consumer

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* Last week we finished “consumer-focused [capabilities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtSaj2avvKCdXLcWu6W4-Np7uKVizLCTmI0KWxqVitE/edit#heading=h.26awb5us0sfq)” - anything further on that work?
* Personas & [Use Cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10oFJrMcIkKb0X7Bw1EwrN1w_wbyVUj0EAUswXMp73lQ/edit#heading=h.pmnr72fd8v8b) - who are we trying to provide value for?
    * Crob: 4 use cases - as an end user I want to know software I’m using is secure; as an OSS software consumer I want to know quality of software I’m ingesting; as an oss developer I need to know techniques & tools; as an OSS developer I want to make high quality software that solves real world problems.
    * _discussion on use cases_
    * Is the mission for the tool chain to only be focused around OSS or for whatever kind of software.
        * Crob: If proprietary software wants to leverage this good work then OK but not the focus
        * Michael: Number 1 priority should be open source but should also be compatible with closed source. Also - something missing - developers want to do the right thing “without making my life any harder.” Feedback from JS world: I don’t want to do a million extra things to make my thing more secure. If a big company comes in and says “you should be doing xyz” not my priority.
        * Crob: changing developer workflows- e.g. adding SBOMS - not necessarily worthwhile work for deelopers.
        * Matt: in JS call we heard “we will not use tools not written in JS” - so even a harder resistance in some ecosystems.
        * Tom: will meeting the 1st use case require … most end users get their products through a process that is often opaque. 
        * Crob: lots of pressures put on “end consumer companies” (like enterprises)
        * Arnaud: I think it’s a red herring - we know OSS is used in proprietary software - our focus is open source. In terms of what we’re trying to achieve we can’t encompass all software. If the tools are useful for OSS then they will be useful for proprietary software as well.
        * _discussion of end users vs open source software consumers…_
        * Sarah: in use case 1 - recommend 
        * Ryan: agree with Arnaud - we can’t boil the ocean.
        * Dan: agree we need to be clear about end users vs technology lay-person
        * Michael: agree we should not boil the ocean - there are definitely people who are stakeholders who are not in the critical path - e.g. people who want to look at the metrics. We should talk more about the personas that are involved.
        * Tracy: end users vs consumers - there are producers and consumers of what’s being produced. Who are the producers - who are the consumers - who are also open source projects and are also the enterprise.
        * Crob: existing personas we can make use of? Vulnerability disclosure working group has a list of personas [wg-vulnerability-disclosures/docs/personas.md at main · ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures (github.com)](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/blob/main/docs/personas.md) 
        * Michael: supply chain wg has a list of personas - but we wanted a broader thing across the OpenSSF. Shared vocabularies. We’ve written a few things.
        * Dan: refer to the vulnerability disclosures wg personas and submit PRs?
        * Arnaud: I’m happy with it but - let’s make sure our PRs are welcome.
        * Crob: Maintainer, finder, supplier, consumer, coordinator <- maintainer, finder and supplier are borrowed from CERT … 
        * Matt: I think Maintainer - is different from contributor…
        * Crob: we want the right level of detail… 
        * Michael: i think it needs to be split up a little bit - burden would fall on different folks - as a maintainer I care about who’s contributing to my code, etc… as a contributor I want to make sure the burden is not too high to contribute code. 2 separate personas right there.
        * Tracy: we define personas so we can craft a message around the personas - we can pull these together and the message might be similar from finder and consumer… to simplify it I think we should have 2 or 3 primary personas. Too granular it’s difficult to to message.
        * Crob: “finder” generally a researcher - a hacker - coordinator is like a CERT…
        * Matt: example of 70 developers - only 3 maintainers - so a lot of discussion on access control… vs how do I fix my bug… 
        * Michael: agree with Matt - we’ve seen a lot of the same things - to talk about who’s accountable / responsible for specific things. Maintainers take on responsibility … and “who’s contributing to the source code” … order of magnitude more contributors as maintainers. We shouldn’t focus purely on the maintainers.
        * Crob: is there value to have multiple developer / maintainer personas defined?
        * Arnaud: I don’t think we should presume we’re going to need them until we find we do.
        * Crob: in future calls we will go through these personas & use cases and do some threat modeling. 
    * Homework is to ponder use cases & personas and suggest edits, feedback etc…

<h3>Agenda</h3>




* Anyone willing to assist in scribing?
    * Jacques jumps on the boomy
* Welcome new friends
    * Mattia Rizzolo from Reproducible Builds, curious to learn more
    * Sarah Evans from Dell, widely involved and keen to help
* Collect Opens
* List of 

<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "resources "). Did you generate a TOC with blue links? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[resources ](#heading=h.lel54j97vxjm)for our project
    * Already done MSVR doc and moved to GH repo
    * Now working through Capabilities doc, see below
    * Eventually use cases, threats, patterns, foundational principles
        * Sarah: Is the foundational principles doc the covenant?
            * CRob: No, about architecture process a la TOGAF
            * Sarah: where has covenant landed?
            * CRob: Best Practices WG
* Continue work on Toolbelt [capabilities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtSaj2avvKCdXLcWu6W4-Np7uKVizLCTmI0KWxqVitE/edit#heading=h.26awb5us0sfq), especially consumer capabilities
    *  [https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society/blob/main/drawings/Sterling%20Toolchain%20Patterns.svg](https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society/blob/main/drawings/Sterling%20Toolchain%20Patterns.svg) 
    * [https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society/blob/main/drawings/Sterling%20Toolchain%20Patterns-1.vsdx](https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society/blob/main/drawings/Sterling%20Toolchain%20Patterns-1.vsdx) 
    * Any followup questions/ issues about Producers?
        * Steve T: looking at package repos as separate column. Was there going to be a GH issue?
        * CRob: was intended, will be set up
    * CRob: Do we feel secure dependency selection really belongs under another heading?
        * Sal: we can talk to maintainers. It doesn’t have to be Dependabot.
        * CRob: from architecture POV don’t want to over fixate on details.
        * Tracy R: want to move Secure Dep Selection to simplify the chart.
        * Steve T: plus it will come up again at Secure Ingestion.	
        * CRob: prob a pattern (as in 90s pattern literature?) that applies in multiple scenarios.
        * Mike L: agree with Tracy and Steve. Lots of secure dep selection is also how secure ingestion works. Cross-cutting pattern. Different orgs will have their own spin on it. Eg. ep that is OK for dev env might not be ok when moving to prod.
        * CRob: goes to reports/attestations moving up and down stream.
        * Sal: not a risk assessment, it’s a threat model. Trying to get info upfront. Which would say is priority for devs to apply?
        * CRob: intention is to work through diagram today and move to use cases.
        * Tracy: to move forward we can accept this may not be perfect today, we can come back and revisit.
    * CRob: let’s go to consumer capabilities
        * Basic capabilities: secure ingestion, implementation and maintenance. No objections to this breakdown.
        * Steve T: just note that secure dependency selection should be included as pattern
        * Mike L: emerging pattern of “binary auth” or “runtime auth”. Each individual check is important and there can be periodic re-checks which cause authority-to-run to be granted. Where would that fit?
        * Sal K: WIP answer. For Security Slam going to do security.txt file to combine with SBOMs etc.
        * Sarah E: in SBOMs Everywhere were talking about automated way to share what’s in your SBOMs. Something’s been produced, someone’s done something with it, want to provide access control to SBOM information. Don’t see OSSF projects anything for SBOM Everywhere. Mechanisms for sharing openly or access-controlled way.
        * Steve T: for secure ingestion we need way to validate/verify that pipeline from producer is valid (eg Tekton chains), not just the artifact itself.
        * Steve T: also need way to federate ingestion data
        * David AW: two different comments. When run automation and analysis? Ideal world where tools are instant, would run all tools at all changes at all steps for immediate response. Ideal world want to maximizer automation for earliest possible feedback. But of course tools can be slow vs pace of change, so not realistic. Want to avoid blanket detailed statements like “run every commit”. Focus on the “automatic” part.
            * CRob: sounds like a principle we can agree on: value of automation
        * Jacques: is there word on OpenSSF Chief Architect?
            * CRob: Omkhar working through candidates, hopefully someone selected soon
        * Steve T: producers will also be consumers and vice versa.
        * Mike L: principle or practice of “bottom turtle”. Paranoid folks might be wonder about the rooting in hardware (Trusted Computing Base). At other end more relaxed folks might root trust at higher level. Choices people make when looking at this will be different for different levels of paranoia and trust-skepticism and risk appetite.
        * Tracy R: With “Ortelius hat” on. Data is useful when related to release candidate. Importance of version of object this relates to. Are we tracking at container, binary, org level?
            * Marcela M: identifying artifacts is a hard problem. Hope to capture somehow in capabilities as a cross-cutting abstraction. Not even a capability. On notion of associating metadata to artifacts, see also in-toto which has this ability.
            * CRob: as we move forward to see which projects have capabilities, want to cast a wide net across other foundations, projects and vendors.
            * Mike L: maybe start where it’s easier  - some ecosystems have firm 1:1 between package version and files, while others just have manifests of pointers to files.
            * CRob: definitely down the road we want to do POCs to stress test capabilities arch.
        * Steve T: a lot of folks reuse same version # with different digests. On secure ingestion side you should have unique version number when bumping deps.
            * Dave AW: if you rebuild and the digests are same, I see problems.
            * Steve T: no for example Chainguard versions bump digest but not version number.
        * Marcela M: going back to federation. How familiar are folks with SCITT?
            * CRob: where would that go?
            * Marcela: Secure ingestion
            * Jacques (who is between employers): says blunt, possibly unkind things about SCITT
            * Sal: will be encouraging folks to use Sigstore.
        * Sarah E: propose under producer linking to SBOM Everywhere. Another thing coming up is whether to sign an SBOM. Having conversations around sigstore distribution. Consumer side, also talked about how to take what was distributed and consume it.
            * CRob: vision of implementation would be we’ve found and vetted SW, now installing it.
        * Sal: tricky to get verification, SBOMs etc for proprietary software. So value of toolchain is not just opensource CI/CD. Excited by Ortelius dashboard, knowing metrics for everything we have SBOMs for. Eg. be able to study update velocity based of data.
        * CRob: Mike L has a proposal about cross-cutting concepts of data storage and control plane.
            * Mike L: Each capability on their own is great, but how do you get them all to work together? Need that kind of K8s-etcd relationship: etcd has the state. K8s does controlling inside cluster. Same thing to some extent here: need some way of saying “I am applying these rules across all these capabilities”, having them describe in one place is important and you want/need a single source of data to apply policy to.
            * Steve T: I think this would come into play with a policy agent.
            * Mike: capability could be one or more policy agents. Had it as “control plane”. Eg Kyverno is _only_ inside K8s, but others can be broader. Could be combo of CLI tools, policy agents etc. Ie it’s a capability not just one particular tool or even class of tools.
            * Tom H: agree it seems more like a capability. Suggest that artifact metadata should move _with_ the artifact. Metadata DBs can become enormous and slow.
            * CRob: how to draw on diagram? Tube that runs L-R?
            * Mike L: each capability has inputs and outputs. Outputs more like log stream that can be ingested
            * Steve T: what I’m hearing is we need a persistent ledger of events from commit to deployment.
            * Jacques: plugs his article for umpteenth time that asset and process data should drain to same store.
            * Mike L: should at some level all go to same place so we can recreate the events _and_ detect gaps in the data.
            * Sal: things get exciting once we can verify SBOMs for binaries they represent. Right now scanning corp repo, but if I have enough SBOMs and they’re validated. What is cybersec event and what is an SRE event? Want to keep idea of timestamp or version. Want to know at end of pipeline, when did I expect to have a new version of own arch given likelihood of vuln in dependency?
        * CRob: do we want to move forward with this basic arch/arrangement?
            * No objections, multiple agreement

<h3>Agenda</h3>




* Anyone willing to assist in scribing?
    * David A. Wheeler
* Welcome new friends
    * Tom Hennen (Google)
    * Marcela Melara (Intel)
* Collect Opens
* [MVSR ](https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society/tree/main/SecurityToolbelt)now in github, please add comments, PRs, and file issues to update. - Brian B & CRob worked out a “final” version to put in GitHub, we now have the GitHub version
* Work on Toolbelt [capabilities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtSaj2avvKCdXLcWu6W4-Np7uKVizLCTmI0KWxqVitE/edit#heading=h.26awb5us0sfq)
* Challenge: Where do we put what?
    * E.g., SAST, etc.: Development environment, or also CI/CD?
    * Key management - Secure developer or secure development environment?
* Developer environment - add linting
* Toolbelt should make it trivial to meet regulatory requirements “like falling out of bed”
    * SBOM generation
    * “Why do I think this is secure” documentation (SSDF, etc, look for this; SSDF is more organization-focused but still)
* What about an “auditing” tool? E.g., check on what is going on? Esp. for oncoming work for liability. E.g., “am I meeting requirements X, Y, and Z”?
    * Is this consumer or developer capability?
    * Eventually both.
* Do we want to add a new “Select reused components” box?
* Talk about “consumer” vs. “producer”
    * Whether or not you’re “upstream” or “downstream” depends on where you are
* (Some interpreted “Ci/CD” differently)
* In general, we want things to happen as “early as possible”

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* Talking about MVSR doc - substantial change to strategy section - reviewing current state of MVSR document.
    * Some discussion on “starting with the top 100 most commonly used OSS projects”... 
        * Dan: yeah I’m not sure what it means “work with the top 100”?
        * Tracey: suggest we take it out
        * Steve: re-word to reference Alpha-Omega? 
        * Crob: we provide whatever output is to Alpha-Omega?
        * Sal: let’s be careful with “top 100” “top critica” because that changes … and if we get stats from ipi, maven central, …
        * Ryan: agree we should just work with Alpha-Omega
        * Crob: partner with Alpha-Omega - to test out with them - relieves some of the burden.
        * David: fine with removing the “100” wording but it should be tested on top projects - so fine to reference Alpha-Omega.  _David wordsmiths_ point is to not just write docs but to test things in the real world
    * Andaud: comments on on 3rd bullet
        * Tracey: i.e. do we need to write it / identify gaps in tooling that  \
… _wordsmithing in doc…_
    * Crob: does the strategy line up with the roadmap?
        * More clarification - stronger wording - we want to highlight around shared vocabulary (step 5). Use cases and threat models… capabilities… highlighting need that the tools speak a unified language. Unified vision while speaking the same language. Different types of events… etc…
        * Dan: shared taxonomies… Really important - to emphasize need for shared language that the industry should adopt.
        * Steve: adding something how to show off what we’ve done…  
            * Crob: roadshow, demo day, etc…
            * Steve: grading system – 
        * Tracey: adding item 9 - develop an outreach strategy
        * Jacques: When are we going back to the board?
            * Crob: July 13 – I am working on a briefing deck. Also aligns with Omkhar’s larger foundation goals. Materials should be done some time in the next few weeks.
        * Sal: If this is a list of projects I can use - radial graphs - a commitment is to communicate and visualize an up to date surface area. List of products available is not useful without knowing architectures - developer profiles.
        * Steve: different tools for Node vs. Go vs. Rust… e.g. Kubernetes & GoLang vs Stand-alone rust programs. 
        * Michael: we should be cautious trying to hit too many vs. picking some of the easiest…. Caution against trying to cover all languages / ecosystems … 
        * Sal: .. with open source .. if you change the identity from end user as developer - change the end user to “a golang developer” (e.g.) then you can map resources…
    * [General agreement on the shape of the document… ]
        * Will review the outstanding comments - and then move to github.
        * Agreement to merge in the new strategy.
* Now discussing **capabilities**
    * “Secure Developer”, “Secure Maintenance” etc.. (see above illustration).
    * Michael: I like - data coming in in a structured way… 
    * Tracey: high level buckets that we can begin defining use cases under…
    * Brandon: SLSA has a high level diagram - [SLSA • Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts](https://slsa.dev/) - 
    * Dan: Packages & Dependencies? Developer choices?
        * Michael: Ingesting at dev time is different from ingesting in production… 
    * Sal: want us to organize this intentionally - where we don’t fall into antipattern - some things are going to be fires forever… are end user and developer the same person? Adding decision forward information for developers (e.g. scorecard) will help. This has to be real…
    * Crob: want to agree on the high-level categories… next time we can take a look a the SLSA diagram.
    * Steve: also look at the “CD Events” diagram.
    * For each:
        * Secure Development Environment: Tools/dashboard to make it easier to evaluate potential reusable components, auto-verify signature when bring it in, warn if likely typosquat; auto prevents dependency confusion
        * Build: Protects build (automatically implements SLSA 3), ingests & generates SBOMs
        * CI/CD: Automatically have tools that identify unknown vulnerabilities in custom code, relevant vulnerabilities in reused components
        * Publish: Easy signing

<h3>Meeting Notes</h3>




* New friends	
    * Andrea Frittoli - CD Foundation and IBM
    * Randal	l
    * Behan Webster
*  MSVR
    * List of top 100 commonly used open source projects
        * Randall: Stuff that is common is missing like Busybox, dnsmasq, sqlite. These are ubiquitous in the embedded world 
        * Pointed to securing software repos group
    * Easy grammatical things we’ll accept in the doc
    * Strategy feels a bit weak
        * Jacques: Roadmap handles “actions” from “diagnosis, constraints, actions” and Strategy doesn’t handle enough on the diagnosis and constraints.
        * Sal: We need to call out who we are working with like CNCF and CDF
        * Tracy: We want to call out building a coalition and building vocabulary
        * BMitch: Fill the gaps covers my expectations: Fill those gaps by adapting existing tools/processes/templates or driving the development of new tools/processes/templates. Address the integration challenges by working with the existing pieces to get to e.g. better APIs. Develop a shared vocabulary to avoid confusion between the parts of the Toolbelt.
        * David: There is an expectation that we’re not just writing a document
        * Jon Meadows: We should identify gaps first. We need to understand the scope and what we’re trying to mitigate
        * Sal: We need the success of a prescriptive approach.
            * Sal: We’ve been running these through CNCF, got over 30% of maintained projects to 80-100% secure by OSSF scorecard in less than 2 months - I’d love to see this extended to broader security architecture: https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-security-slam/
        * Andrea: There’s lots of data from the different boxes (capabilities). We need to make sure they talk together well in the architecture.
        * Aeva: Most open source comes with code, and this current group feels like we’re trying to design a product. We also haven’t been tasked with securing LF projects
        * Arno: We need to capture
        * Behan: Just because there’s a standard and tooling doesn’t mean people will use it/do it. It’s not just a problem of adoption, it’s a problem with trying to upstream what they’ve found, issues, vulns, etc.
        * Mike: It’s still not clear what the problem we’re trying to solve
        * Jacques: It feels like the governing board came up with a solution and we are tasked with finding the problem. Should we be focused on building a toolbelt? Should we be more diffuse and focused on other things?
        * Aeva: We are not obligated to follow the marching orders of the Governing Board. We might want to look at going back and figure out whether or not that’s something worth doing in the first place.
        * Sal: My approach to digital safety, falls under this thinking. If LF takes a real, long horizon, this would be my approach, but yeah, it’s pretty math: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ps-GAUEG_HLjdQDemZUt14pmZpf32wtR7sHym5yIfuI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ps-GAUEG_HLjdQDemZUt14pmZpf32wtR7sHym5yIfuI/edit?usp=sharing)
        * Jon: It doesn’t have to be a toolbelt, but we should look at the problem, capabilities, etc.
        * Randall: Lots of folks define security differently
        * Behan: Telling someone to use a specific toolchain is going to be impossible. There are decades of stuff there. Maybe we need to change the standards to fit the tools.
        * Mike: We should call out what we’re not doing in the document
        * Aeva: Yes we should call that out
        * Sal: We need to have an understanding of how big this undertaking will take. We also need to make sure we can provide resources to help
        * Behan: There is some tooling in the embedded world (Yocto Project, and OpenEmbedded)
        * Mike: It is still worthwhile to probably highlight that we’re looking to help fix the end to end problem. Not necessarily develop a suite of tools, but today there’s a ton of issues around folks even knowing what the end to end scope is. Where do they get started, e.g. I generated an SBOM but am not consuming SBOMs, I’m securing ingestion but not the build. What is the scope?
        * Next actions, be back here in two weeks to finish this.

    * Problem: “Develop” in the mission statement isn’t right, often it’s existing tools. What word to use is hard to agree on. develop / specify / mature / distill / evolve / assemble. Decided on “assemble”.
    * “Vision” is WAY too long. Moving text around.
    * A lot of the “Strategy” is really a roadmap, reorganized.
    * The group worked through the document, working to refine it.

<h3>Agenda</h3>




* Anyone willing to assist in scribing?
    * Brian Behlendorf raises hand
* Welcome new friends
    * Sal Kimmich, Dan Appelquist, Jon Meadows, Phil Estes, Joshua Lock, David Wheeler, Steve Taylor, Tracy Ragan, Jay White, Georg Kunz, Jeff Borek, Mike Leiberman, BrianB, Jacques, Brandon
* Collect Opens
* We’ll house our work under the Diagrammers Society [repo](https://github.com/ossf/Diagrammers-Society)
    * Humble suggestion by CRob to house these efforts at DS repo, at least for now.
    * Diagrammer’s Society is a SIG directly under the TAC & its goal is to clarify how all works together.
    * Brian Behlendorf: It’s easy to create a new repo, if it’d be better to create one then let’s do it.
* TAC Issue [151](https://github.com/ossf/tac/issues/151) - [For Review] - Initial thoughts on Sterling Toolchain Concept
    * Jacques: is this about describing the world, or making changes to it?
    * Jon: Can we keep it vague enough to be useful, but not specific enough to be wedded to identified tools?
    * Sal: what delta do we want to measure? What do we want to build?
    * David: agree with comment that documents != automation. We need code not just docs. But people will not switch from their current tools [easily?] If the tool already exists, help people plug the tool into their system. Make everything easier to use.
    * Tracy: we have changes in CD pipelines, over 20 million of them out there, they’d have to be modified to even include SBOMs. CD Foundation is pushing for “[CD Events](https://cdevents.dev/)”. This group should be involved in that work - driving vocabulary and payloads that you want to see added. Link: [cdevents.dev](https://cdevents.dev/)
    * Brian: ask from the governing board is intended to be opinionated and specific. Opposite end of the spectrum from “always more than one way” - recognizing the cost of optionality. The idea is to say “this is the sterling approach. Combine these tools in this way.” Opportunity to consolidate.
    * Steve Taylor: Inflexibility is a problem. The current Scorecard action (that automatically re-runs Scorecard on change) assumes GitHub Actions - I have 20K Jenkins jobs that this can’t apply to. Things vary depending on the CI/CD pipeline, programming language(s) used, etc.
    * Sal: Working with CDF & CNCF is important. No CNCF project could do a non-manual SBOM. Learning about the pain points is critical.
    * Tracy: all those can be mapped to CD Events
    * CRob: Never seen any effort succeed on just a tool - always a blend of people, process, & technology to be successful. Diagram focuses on capabilities. Here are patterns that help support that capability.
    * Dan: how does the opinionated-take align with the tool makers’ interests?
    * Brian: I don’t think we can be opinionated on all things, we should only be opinionated (if we are) on open material. It’s our hope that the tool vendors will want to support this because it’ll make it simpler for them to be integrated by customers into their systems.
    * Steve: we need to think about both upstream and downstream
    * Sal: Does this include a dashboard? Real time? A compelling sell needs to be able to show the system works, and generates measurable outcomes like better MTTR. How do we measure the value being delivered?
    * Mike: I def agree that data needs to be made available, that should be required
    * Tracy: lots of folks have dashboards, Artelius is one, RH is working on another. Incorporate the tools already out there.
    * Steve: a default dashboard of our own of some sort is the route we need to go. E.g., to show status across many projects, as well as one specific projects.
    * Jay: Needs to be a consensus on what this toolchain is supposed to be exactly, to decide on next steps, on what metrics are relevant. We don’t have enough graphics cards to display all the data we want to analyze. We should get some more basics going first - how often are we going to meet, etc?
    * CRob: we are meeting at this time every week. 
    * Sal: As an SRE, I try to define what the parameters for “looseness” is in any endeavor, finding a balance between specificity and flexibility. 
    * David: I agree we need a list of what the toolchain is supposed to do. The “Sterling Toolchain Concept” document has a list of required functionality, don’t take it as gospel but it should be a helpful starting point: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4YxuT6yzbgrNlUpgTbJhuKv5ngdsd6O8Dz5yRTepgs/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4YxuT6yzbgrNlUpgTbJhuKv5ngdsd6O8Dz5yRTepgs/edit#) - my presumption is that the group will update/refine.
    * CRob: do we want to set up a mailing list? Or is Slack enough? 
    * Brian: some folks can’t participate by Slack
    * Tracy: we should get started on the doc.
    * Joshua: Google docs are also restricted. I’ve had more success with hackmd, that lets you collaboratively edit markdown files. [https://hackmd.io/](https://hackmd.io/)
    * Brian: I envision the Chief Architect doing this. Until this happens, I’ll be happy to step into the gap to develop a first draft of the MSVR for this..
    * Is a mailing list desired? Yes, make one.
    * Brian: I hope we come up with a better name. Something a bit edgy. “Pick favorites” sure, but move away from the idea of replacing everything. “Golden toolbelt”.
        * Everyone agrees they hate the current name
        * Utility Belt. Utility Belt.
        * “GOOSE” — figure out a backronym ;)
    * https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C057BN7K19B
    * 
* Work on mission, vision, scope for this effort
    * Please come to next meeting with ideas for this.
    * **Action Item**: Brian to come to next meeting with a first draft.
* “Sterling Toolchain Concept” text here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4YxuT6yzbgrNlUpgTbJhuKv5ngdsd6O8Dz5yRTepgs/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z4YxuT6yzbgrNlUpgTbJhuKv5ngdsd6O8Dz5yRTepgs/edit#)
