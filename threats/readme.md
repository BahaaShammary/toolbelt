# Security Toolbelt Threats

The Security Toolbelt has identified a series of threats that are possible within (open source) software supply chains.  We've documented these Threats and organized them according to their presence at specific stages or the lifecycle of the software being developed:

Details of each area is documented in a corresponding file.
