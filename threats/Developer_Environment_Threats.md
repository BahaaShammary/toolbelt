The following threats have been identified to be in scope that threaten the Secure Developer Environment capability:

## TBT-1100 (Category) TBT-2100 (Category) Failure to perform Cyber Hygiene regularly creates Insecure development environment
- Missing or not up to date tools (e.g.AV/EDR leads to Malware infection)
- Unpatched Dev Env with exploitable vulns
- Use of software and tools with vulnerabilities; harden/patch software and tools
- Use of Operating system with vulnerabilities; harden/patch OS
- Insecure configurations, e.g. unprotected cryptographic secrets
## TBT-2200 (Category) Failure to analyze/validate code and configurations leads to insecure software
- Missed analysis (e.g. static configuration analysis, 
- symptom could be missing SCA tool tools
- Symptom could be misconfigured tool
- Symptom could be using the wrong tool (unintended purpose, or tool not capable of accomplishing the purpose)
## TBT-2300 (Category) Reliance on Code generation (AI tool assistants, auto-code generation utilities) without understanding/critique code output
- 

## Assumptions
- Development environment can range from an unmanaged local IDE on a laptop/workstation, a local installation of development SCM and CI tools, a corporate-controlled and managed workstation, to a virtualized machine in a corporate VDE or any combination.
